This project is a collection of multiple nested applications, built using the Angular and Ionic Framework. Each application serves a distinct purpose, to demonstrate my User Interface flexibility. Below is an overview of each application within the project.


The first sub-application is the Pokedex app, a playful and interactive tool for fans of the Pokémon universe. It consists of two main pages: a search page and a list page. On the search page, users can either generate a random Pokémon or search for a specific one. Once a Pokémon is displayed, users can tap on it to view detailed information and have the option to "Catch" it. The caught Pokémon are stored in the list page, which serves as the user's personal collection. From the list page, users can tap on any captured Pokémon to view its details, including its shiny form, adding an engaging and collectible element to the application. 

The second sub-application focuses on integrating with The Construct API, which connects to Accela's API for managing government-related inspections and records. This component begins with a dynamic input form where users specify the agency they are affiliated with. Upon submission, an API call retrieves the available environments for that agency. Users then select an environment and enter their credentials to sign in. If the agency name is modified, the related fields are reset, requiring a new environment fetch. Once authenticated, the application retrieves and stores an access token, which is used to fetch and display the user's assigned records as cards. Each card contains essential information about the record, such as its type, ID, assigned user, and status, providing an intuitive interface for managing government records efficiently.

The final sub-application is called The Machine Learning Digit Predictor. It leverages MNIST, which is short for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database. This leverages machine learning to recognize handwritten digits. Users can draw a number on a canvas, and the application uses TensorFlow.js to load a pre-trained model hosted at /assets/trained_model/model.json. This model is loaded during the Angular component's initialization via the ngOnInit lifecycle hook. Once loaded, the application is capable of analyzing the drawn input, predicting, and then outputting the intended digit to the user. This sub-application provides an accessible and interactive demonstration of machine learning in action, to which I consider to be the crown jewel of my application.
